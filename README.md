# Semantic-Aware Transformer Framework for Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Embeddings (MSHGT)
The work is at the investment stage.
## Requirements

#### 1. Neural network libraries for GNNs

* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
* [pytorch-geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)


Please check your cuda version first and install the above libraries matching your cuda. If possible, we recommend to install the latest versions of these libraries.

## Data preparation

You can use download IMDB, DBLP, LastFM by using dataset class in torch_geometric.datasets. For Pubmed, ACM and Yelp, please them from [the source of HGB benchmark] (https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/fc10cb35d19047a88cb1/?p=NC)
